# 接口
PodWorkers是kubelet中用于处理Pod相关操作的接口。
1. UpdatePod：podWorkers最重要的方法，传入一个UpdatePodOptions，对Pod的改动进行应用

## 接口
```go
// pkg/kubelet/pod_workers.go
type PodWorkers interface {
	// UpdatePod notifies the pod worker of a change to a pod, which will then
	// be processed in FIFO order by a goroutine per pod UID. The state of the
	// pod will be passed to the syncPod method until either the pod is marked
	// as deleted, it reaches a terminal phase (Succeeded/Failed), or the pod
	// is evicted by the kubelet. Once that occurs the syncTerminatingPod method
	// will be called until it exits successfully, and after that all further
	// UpdatePod() calls will be ignored for that pod until it has been forgotten
	// due to significant time passing. A pod that is terminated will never be
	// restarted.
	UpdatePod(options UpdatePodOptions)
	// SyncKnownPods removes workers for pods that are not in the desiredPods set
	// and have been terminated for a significant period of time. Once this method
	// has been called once, the workers are assumed to be fully initialized and
	// subsequent calls to ShouldPodContentBeRemoved on unknown pods will return
	// true. It returns a map describing the state of each known pod worker.
	SyncKnownPods(desiredPods []*v1.Pod) map[types.UID]PodWorkerState

	// IsPodKnownTerminated returns true if the provided pod UID is known by the pod
	// worker to be terminated. If the pod has been force deleted and the pod worker
	// has completed termination this method will return false, so this method should
	// only be used to filter out pods from the desired set such as in admission.
	//
	// Intended for use by the kubelet config loops, but not subsystems, which should
	// use ShouldPod*().
	IsPodKnownTerminated(uid types.UID) bool
	// CouldHaveRunningContainers returns true before the pod workers have synced,
	// once the pod workers see the pod (syncPod could be called), and returns false
	// after the pod has been terminated (running containers guaranteed stopped).
	//
	// Intended for use by the kubelet config loops, but not subsystems, which should
	// use ShouldPod*().
	CouldHaveRunningContainers(uid types.UID) bool
	// IsPodTerminationRequested returns true when pod termination has been requested
	// until the termination completes and the pod is removed from config. This should
	// not be used in cleanup loops because it will return false if the pod has already
	// been cleaned up - use ShouldPodContainersBeTerminating instead. Also, this method
	// may return true while containers are still being initialized by the pod worker.
	//
	// Intended for use by the kubelet sync* methods, but not subsystems, which should
	// use ShouldPod*().
	IsPodTerminationRequested(uid types.UID) bool

	// ShouldPodContainersBeTerminating returns false before pod workers have synced,
	// or once a pod has started terminating. This check is similar to
	// ShouldPodRuntimeBeRemoved but is also true after pod termination is requested.
	//
	// Intended for use by subsystem sync loops to avoid performing background setup
	// after termination has been requested for a pod. Callers must ensure that the
	// syncPod method is non-blocking when their data is absent.
	ShouldPodContainersBeTerminating(uid types.UID) bool
	// ShouldPodRuntimeBeRemoved returns true if runtime managers within the Kubelet
	// should aggressively cleanup pod resources that are not containers or on disk
	// content, like attached volumes. This is true when a pod is not yet observed
	// by a worker after the first sync (meaning it can't be running yet) or after
	// all running containers are stopped.
	// TODO: Once pod logs are separated from running containers, this method should
	// be used to gate whether containers are kept.
	//
	// Intended for use by subsystem sync loops to know when to start tearing down
	// resources that are used by running containers. Callers should ensure that
	// runtime content they own is not required for post-termination - for instance
	// containers are required in docker to preserve pod logs until after the pod
	// is deleted.
	ShouldPodRuntimeBeRemoved(uid types.UID) bool
	// ShouldPodContentBeRemoved returns true if resource managers within the Kubelet
	// should aggressively cleanup all content related to the pod. This is true
	// during pod eviction (when we wish to remove that content to free resources)
	// as well as after the request to delete a pod has resulted in containers being
	// stopped (which is a more graceful action). Note that a deleting pod can still
	// be evicted.
	//
	// Intended for use by subsystem sync loops to know when to start tearing down
	// resources that are used by non-deleted pods. Content is generally preserved
	// until deletion+removal_from_etcd or eviction, although garbage collection
	// can free content when this method returns false.
	ShouldPodContentBeRemoved(uid types.UID) bool
	// IsPodForMirrorPodTerminatingByFullName returns true if a static pod with the
	// provided pod name is currently terminating and has yet to complete. It is
	// intended to be used only during orphan mirror pod cleanup to prevent us from
	// deleting a terminating static pod from the apiserver before the pod is shut
	// down.
	IsPodForMirrorPodTerminatingByFullName(podFullname string) bool
}
```
1. ShouldPodContentBeRemoved：跟踪pod是否应该仍然存在，包括在SyncKnownPods()被调用一次后不存在的pod
2. SyncKnownPods：传入一个PodList，PodWorkers会移除缓存里所有不在其中的PodWorker，并返回现存所有缓存中的Pod及其状态。用于清理操作
3. IsPodKnownTerminated：判断Pod是否被终止，如果Pod没找到，返回false
4. CouldHaveRunningContainers：判断Pod是否还有Running的容器
5. IsPodTerminationRequested：判断Pod是否已接收到终止请求
6. ShouldPodContainersBeTerminating：判断Pod是否已开始终止操作
7. ShouldPodRuntimeBeRemoved：判断Pod的容器是否可以移除。用于清理操作
8. ShouldPodRuntimeBeRemoved：判断Pod是否可以开始资源回收，只在完成Pod终止后返回true。用于清理操作
9. ShouldPodContentBeRemoved：判断Pod是否可以开始资源回收，接收到驱逐请求时该方法立即返回true。用于清理操作
10. IsPodForMirrorPodTerminatingByFullName：如果指定Pod名字的MirrorPod对应的StaticPod正在终止中状态，该方法返回true。用于清理时判断可否删除mirrorPod
