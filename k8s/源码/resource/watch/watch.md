# watch
watch是k8s中用于获取资源对象变化的机制，底层使用`httpchunked`特性实现。实现类一般为`StreamWatcher`

## 接口
```go
// k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/watch/watch.go
type Interface interface {
	// Stops watching. Will close the channel returned by ResultChan(). Releases
	// any resources used by the watch.
	Stop()

	// Returns a chan which will receive all the events. If an error occurs
	// or Stop() is called, the implementation will close this channel and
	// release any resources used by the watch.
	ResultChan() <-chan Event
}

type Event struct {
	Type EventType

	// Object is:
	//  * If Type is Added or Modified: the new state of the object.
	//  * If Type is Deleted: the state of the object immediately before deletion.
	//  * If Type is Bookmark: the object (instance of a type being watched) where
	//    only ResourceVersion field is set. On successful restart of watch from a
	//    bookmark resourceVersion, client is guaranteed to not get repeat event
	//    nor miss any events.
	//  * If Type is Error: *api.Status is recommended; other types may make sense
	//    depending on context.
	Object runtime.Object
}

// EventType defines the possible types of events.
type EventType string

const (
	Added    EventType = "ADDED"
	Modified EventType = "MODIFIED"
	Deleted  EventType = "DELETED"
	Bookmark EventType = "BOOKMARK"
	Error    EventType = "ERROR"
)
```
1. Stop：停止watch操作
2. ResultChan：获取一个channel，从该channel中可以消费出保存了对象变化的Event
