Deployment资源对象的控制器

## 结构体
```go
// pkg/controller/deployment/deployment_controller.go
type DeploymentController struct {
	// rsControl is used for adopting/releasing replica sets.
	rsControl     controller.RSControlInterface
	client        clientset.Interface
	eventRecorder record.EventRecorder

	// To allow injection of syncDeployment for testing.
	syncHandler func(ctx context.Context, dKey string) error
	// used for unit testing
	enqueueDeployment func(deployment *apps.Deployment)

	// dLister can list/get deployments from the shared informer's store
	dLister appslisters.DeploymentLister
	// rsLister can list/get replica sets from the shared informer's store
	rsLister appslisters.ReplicaSetLister
	// podLister can list/get pods from the shared informer's store
	podLister corelisters.PodLister

	// dListerSynced returns true if the Deployment store has been synced at least once.
	// Added as a member to the struct to allow injection for testing.
	dListerSynced cache.InformerSynced
	// rsListerSynced returns true if the ReplicaSet store has been synced at least once.
	// Added as a member to the struct to allow injection for testing.
	rsListerSynced cache.InformerSynced
	// podListerSynced returns true if the pod store has been synced at least once.
	// Added as a member to the struct to allow injection for testing.
	podListerSynced cache.InformerSynced

	// Deployments that need to be synced
	queue workqueue.RateLimitingInterface

1. rsControl：用控制ReplicaSet
2. client：clientSet
3. syncHandler：用于重同步的函数
