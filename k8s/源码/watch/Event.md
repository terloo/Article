# Event

## 结构体
```go
type EventType string

const (
	Added    EventType = "ADDED"
	Modified EventType = "MODIFIED"
	Deleted  EventType = "DELETED"
	Bookmark EventType = "BOOKMARK"
	Error    EventType = "ERROR"
)

// Event represents a single event to a watched resource.
// +k8s:deepcopy-gen=true
type Event struct {
	Type EventType

	// Object is:
	//  * If Type is Added or Modified: the new state of the object.
	//  * If Type is Deleted: the state of the object immediately before deletion.
	//  * If Type is Bookmark: the object (instance of a type being watched) where
	//    only ResourceVersion field is set. On successful restart of watch from a
	//    bookmark resourceVersion, client is guaranteed to not get repeat event
	//    nor miss any events.
	//  * If Type is Error: *api.Status is recommended; other types may make sense
	//    depending on context.
	Object runtime.Object
}
```
